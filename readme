To be able to "make" this project, you need to download and configure/make newlib. Because this projects uses some functions like memcpy utility function.

Download newlib from ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/index.html and run configure with following options. Than run make. You will have newlib archive files required for the linker in "newlib-2.2.0-1/arm-none-eabi/newlib", so you have to modify you makefile

%../configure --target=arm-none-eabi  \
             --enable-interwork  \
             --disable-newlib-supplied-syscalls  \
             --with-gnu-ld  \
             --with-gnu-as  \
             --disable-shared

%make 

*I downloaded newlib 2.2.0.1, and did cross compile from a different directory build directory (newlib-2.2.0-1-build)
